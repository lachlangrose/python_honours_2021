    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpetive programming language. This means that the code that you write is converted into instructions for the computer when you run the code. To be able to run python code we need to have a Python interpeter installed on the computer. There are many different ways that this can be done and in some cases your computer may already have an interpeter. One of the appeals of Python is the large community that develop tools and libraries that can be applied to your own problems. These libraries provide additional instructions for the interpeted and can change how specific aspects of the code are run. In some cases the wrong combination of libraries will result in an error, or unexpected results. For this reason it is very important to be able to manage the different libaries that are being used for a specific problem.\n",

A virtual environment can be created for a particular project or task and you can be sure that you do not contaminate an existing project trying new libraries. **Virtual environments might seem uncessary at first but they can be very useful for managing advanced projects**\n",
