    "# Project 1: Analysing the IRIS dataset\n",
    "This project uses the Iris data set which is a multivariate dataset containing 150 records measuring width and length of the iris flower sepals and petals. The iris dataset is in a csv `iris.csv`\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Create a scatter plot of all combination of variables \n",
    "2. Normalise each observations to be between 0,1 \n",
    "3. Calculate a distance matrix measuring the distance between each sample and every other sample in the normalised measurement space - try and use numpy syntax here e.g. look at np.linalg.norm and the axis argument, also look at using `None` indexing\n",
    "4. Can you see any groups in the distance matrix?\n",
    "5. Try and implement a k-means clustering algorithm to label these groups of data\n",
    "6. Try adding the classifications to the scatter plot using the c argument.\n",
    "7. Compare the clustering results to the distance matrix\n",
    "8. Use an existing implementation such as the `sklearn.cluster.kmeans` and compare your results to the results of this algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some pseudocode\n",

    "```\n",
    "Randomly generate starting K centroids by randomly selecting K observations  \n",

    "while not converged:\n",
    "    Associate every observation with its nearest centroid\n",
    "    The centroid of the new clusters becomes the new mean\n",

    "* 15% of the marks for the presentation and communication of the results, try and make the figures paper quality\n",
    "* 5% of the mark will be the coherency of the jupyter notebook \n"
